# Casting Agency
The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies.

## Motivation
This is a Casting Agency Capstone Project requierd for Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

This project covers: 
- Data modeling using `postgres`.
- API development and testing using `Flask`.
- Authentication using `Auth0`.
- Authorization with `Role-Based Access Control`.
- API deployment using `Heroku`.

## Dependencies

### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight SQLite database.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. 

#### Python
Install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python).

#### Virtual Environment
This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

#### PIP Dependencies
Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the server
Each time you open a new terminal session, run: `FLASK_APP=app.py`
To run the server, execute:`flask run --reload`

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.
